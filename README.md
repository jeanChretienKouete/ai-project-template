# AI Project Folder Structure

This project follows a well-organized folder structure to keep the codebase clean, scalable, and maintainable. Below is an explanation of each folder and file within the project.

## Folder Structure

### `data/`

Contains all data-related files for the project.

- **`raw/`**: Original, unprocessed data.
- **`processed/`**: Cleaned and preprocessed data.
- **`external/`**: Data from external sources.

### `logs/`

Contains log files generated during experiments, model training, and other activities. Logs help track the progress of experiments, errors, and outputs for debugging.

### `models/`

Stores the saved models from training. These models can be loaded later for inference or further training.

### `notebooks/`

Contains Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation and exploration. This is where you can visualize data, try different models, and perform any analysis.

### `scripts/`

Contains standalone scripts used to run the entire pipeline or generate results. For example:

- **`train_model.py`**: Script for training a model.
- **`run_inference.py`**: Script to run inference with the trained model.

### `src/`

The main source code for the AI project. This is structured into different modules to keep things organized:

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes the directory a Python package.
- **`data/`**: Contains data preprocessing functions, such as cleaning and transforming the data.
- **`features/`**: Functions for feature engineering, including creating new features or selecting important ones.
- **`models/`**: Contains model definitions, including various machine learning or deep learning architectures (e.g., neural networks, regression models).
- **`utils/`**: Helper functions and utilities (e.g., data loading, evaluation metrics, etc.).

### `tests/`

Contains unit tests or other types of tests for the project. These tests ensure that all the individual components are functioning correctly and help maintain code quality.

## Configuration & Docker

- **`.dockerignore`**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore when building the Docker image.
- **`.env.example`**: Example environment variable file. You should copy this to `.env` and adjust the variables accordingly for your environment.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control, such as log files and saved models.
- **`Dockerfile`**: If you plan to containerize the project using Docker, this file defines how to set up the Docker container for the project.

## Project Dependencies

- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python dependencies (e.g., libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) required to run the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: Project license information (if applicable).
